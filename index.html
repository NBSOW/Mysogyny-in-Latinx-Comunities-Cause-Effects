 <h3>What is Misogyny?</h3><br>
   Misogyny is the belief that women are the weaker sex and inferior to the male sex. It includes the rejection of any version that is non traditional. It is an idea that, when instilled, creates people who promote sexism</h4>
<br>

   
   <br>
<h3>Why is it a problem?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Insecurities</li>
<li>They live by other peoples opinion
</li>
<li>Emotional Supression</li>
<li>Emotional Disorders</li>
<li>Repeated Behaviour</li>
<li>Impostor Sindrome</li>
<li>See emotions as faults </li>
<il>Incapable of showing emotion</il>
<li>More likely to be in or make an abusive relationship
<li>more prone to depression/anxiety</li>
</ul>

   
<br><center>...and the list goes on</center>

<br>   
<a id="2"<h3>Why is it more common in latinx families?</h3>
  
<br>
<p><br>59 million of the inhabitants in the US are Latinx, that is to say that 62% of the families are Latinx and 18.7% of those Latinx families are immigrants or 3rd generation. These families, in addition to suffering from economic crises, racism, homophobia and other types of discrimination, suffer from misogynism. This is because of how important tradition is.<br>
  
</br>
  
<br></br>Those responsible for parenting are the ones who normally encourage misogynism. In the case of Latinx families, “traditional” is always correct. men are the ones who maintain order in the home, provide for the home and dedicate themselves to fixing and protecting. Instead, the woman is seen as a delicate piece, made to breastfeed, raise, cook and a decent being. When reality is very different and varies. Breeders just keep rehearsing this because "that's the way it is, that's the way they were raised." Without remembering how difficult and confusing it is for a young Latinx to experience constant discrimination, not only in the world but also in their homes.</p>

<a id="4"><h3>What is the solution?</h3>
<br>

  <ol>
<li><h4>Redefine:</h4><br>
  
Let's try not to define what a woman or a man is. So that the community does not feel the constant pressure to meet society's expectations. We are all different therefore you cannot generalize or judge.  </li><br>
<li><h4>Re teach:</h4><br>
It is understood that being from different eras / generations there are different customs. But that should not limit us. Whenever possible try to correct this behavior. So that little by little everyone learns (from children to the elderly).
</li><br>

<li><h4>Heal and be better:<br></h4>
It is not ignoring misogynistic behavior, it is recognizing it and being able to not repeat it, not only for your own good but for the good of future generations. Because if people refuse to change, their ideals would simply be based on emotions and not reality. Passing on again, their traumas and toxic ideals to the next generations. We must remember that not everything we are taught is correct, therefore we must have open minds for change.
